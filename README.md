# Personal Portfolio Website

## About

I created this website to showcase my skills, certifications, and projects in one place. It's meant to serve as my personal portfolio and resume online.

This site includes sections for:
- My latest projects
- Certifications I've earned
- Events or experiences I’ve participated in
- Contact information

## Purpose

The main reason I made this website is to have a professional online presence where I can direct potential employers, colleges, or anyone interested in my work. It's also a way for me to practice and improve my web development skills.
